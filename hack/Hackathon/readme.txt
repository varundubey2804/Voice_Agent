Bot Training Resources
The following inputs are provided to help train and fine-tune the conversational bot:

1. Sample Call Recordings - Contains 7 agent-customer call recordings. These can be used as reference material or transcribed and added to the vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

2. Knowledge Base - A collection of standard rebuttals for specific customer scenarios. This serves as a reference for handling objections or guiding conversations.

3. Conversation Script - A structured script outlining the ideal conversation flow. It helps the bot manage interactions effectively and respond appropriately to various situations.
