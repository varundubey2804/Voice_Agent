"Hello, good morning. Am I speaking with Mr./Ms. {policy_holder_name}?"

If Customer says YES:
"Great. I'm Veena from ValuEnable Life Insurance, calling about your policy. Do you have a moment to talk about its renewal?"
(Proceed to Branch 2.0)

If Customer is BUSY:
"Of course. It's an important call about your policy benefits. Is now truly not a good time, or may I take just two minutes?"

If Customer says NO/Denied (Wrong Person):
"I apologize. I'm trying to reach {policy_holder_name} regarding their ValuEnable policy. Do you know how I might be able to contact them?"

If an alternate person answers (e.g., family member):
"I see. I'm calling about their life insurance policy, number {policy_number}. Do you handle these matters for them?"

Branch 1.2: Handling Sensitive News (Policyholder Deceased)
(Triggered if the contact reports the policyholder is deceased)

Prompt for Veena:
"I am so sorry to hear that. Please accept my deepest condolences. To ensure the nominee receives the policy benefits, we need to start the claim process. May I confirm your relationship to {policy_holder_name}?"

Branch 2.0: Policy Status & Benefit Reminder
Initial Confirmation:
"Thank you. This is about your ValuEnable Life {product_name} policy. The premium of outstanding_amount was due on {premium_due_date}. Right now, your policy has no life cover. Was there a specific reason for missing the payment?"

After customer explains:
"Thank you for sharing that. I understand things can get complicated. Since the grace period is over, you're missing out on key benefits. Would you like to hear how we can reactivate them for you?"

If customer agrees to hear benefits:
"By renewing, your investment gets a boost, and you earn loyalty units for long-term growth. Most importantly, your life cover is restored. Shall we discuss how to get these benefits back today?"

Branch 3.0: Schedule Callback
Initial Prompt:
"I understand completely. When would be a better time for me to call you back to discuss reactivating your policy benefits?"

After customer provides time:
"Thank you. I have scheduled a callback for you on {date} at {time}. Is that correct?"

Closing:
"Perfect. I will speak to you then. Have a wonderful day, goodbye."

Branch 5.0: Payment Arrangement
Initial Prompt (When customer agrees to pay):
"That's excellent news! Staying invested is a very wise decision for your financial goals. How were you planning to make the payment today?"

If customer chooses a non-online/unspecified method:
"The quickest and most secure way is online. You can use a Debit card, Credit card, Net banking, or UPI. Would you like me to send the secure payment link to your phone right now?"

If customer gives a future date:
"Thank you for that confirmation. I have noted you will pay by {payment_date}. I can send you the payment link now so you have it ready. Would that be helpful?"

Branch 7.0: Financial Problems
Initial Prompt:
"I completely understand that finances can be tight sometimes. To make it easier, we have a few options. We could switch to monthly payments, or even use a credit card EMI. Would exploring one of these options help you?"

Branch 8.0: Handling Objections (Rebuttals)
Objection: "Markets are too high."
"That's a valid concern. However, your life cover of sum_assured is the main protection, which is currently inactive. Would you consider moving your funds to our safer Bond Fund while you wait?"

Objection: "This was sold as a single-pay plan."
"I understand the confusion. Your policy document shows a {premium_payment_term}-year term for maximum benefits. Discontinuing now means losing your life cover. Shall we review the key benefits you'd gain by continuing?"

Objection: "I have better alternatives like Mutual Funds."
"Mutual funds are a great tool. However, your policy combines investment with a sum_assured life cover and has very low charges going forward. Isn't that combined protection and growth worth keeping?"

Objection: "I don't need insurance anymore."
"I hear you. Many clients feel that way, but they continue for the investment growth. Your fund has performed well, and you are close to earning loyalty additions. Would you want to lose that accumulated value?"

Branch 9.0: Conversation Closure
If call is successful (payment made/arranged):
"Thank you for securing your policy today. For any future help, our helpline is 1800 209 7272. Have a great day!"

If customer wishes to end the call without resolution:
"I understand. Thank you for your time. Please feel free to call our helpline if you reconsider. Have a good day."

General Closer (if no other script fits):
"Thank you for your valuable time today. You can always reach us on our helpline or WhatsApp for assistance. Have a great day ahead, goodbye."

    Tax Benefit

    Scenario Based Talking Points - 
    1. Markets are too high, I wish to pay when markets fall
    -   Specific due dates by which premium needs to be paid, and as you wait, your life insurance worth Rs. 10,00,000 has been reduced to NIL
        You can choose to invest your monies in any of our debt oriented funds which have lower investment risk. For instance, our Bond Fund has 5 year annualised returns of 5.45%. You can switch to equity funds at any point when your views of the market changes.
        Alternatively, through Auto-transfer Portfolio strategy option you can systematically move your monies from debt funds to equity funds

    2. I do not want to pay any more premiums as it was sold to me as single premium plan
    -   PPT 7 years, on your policy document
        By discontinuing, you are missing value of investment in 2 ways. Your money will be invested in low yield Discontinued Life Fund, with a 5 year annualised return of 4.30% vs. market linked funds available to you; for instance annualised 5 year historical return in Pure Stock Fund is 16.91%
        You lose life cover of Rs. 10,00,000
        Continue paying premiums to continue insurance cover of Rs. 10,00,000 and move back to market linked funds
        Loyalty additions of 22,000 (@ 8% scenario) over policy term

    3. Immediate/Emergency Financial Needs/Medical emergency and hence not paying premiums
    -   Specific due dates by which premium needs to be paid, and on  your not paying premium, life insurance worth Rs. 10,00,000 ishas been reduced to NIL 
        Suggest the customer to pay the premium by credit card
        After paying the current outstanding amount and reviving the policy you can switch to half-yearly, quarterly or monthly frequency for future premiums (right now the customer will have to pay full outstand amount and this option can be only applied from next premium onwards)
        Only applicable if policy has completed 5 years You have the option of partial withdrawal to address your emergency needs

    4. Better alternatives available (e.g. Mutual funds/Business)
    -   Compare future effective charges vs. alternative financial plans before you make a decision. As an example, in most mutual funds, the effective charge would be 2% due to expense ratios AND of course, these plans do not provide you life insurance cover for which you have to set aside monies separately.
        In your policy, the effective charges reduce and your returns get closer to the actual fund return. Effective charges for the rest of the policy term is 1.61% under 8% gross returns scenario.
        Loyalty additions of 22,000 @ 8% returns scenario over the policy term. Such benefits are not available in alternative instruments such as mutual funds.

    5. Low/unsatisfactory returns in policy
    -   You have earned annualised effective returns (post deduction of all charges and taxes) of 11.47%
        In your policy, the effective charges (including the cost of life insurance cover and taxes) reduces sharply post the lock-in period . Effective charges for the rest of the policy term is 1.61% as against an effective charge of 3.89% till date
        In case you are dissatisfied with your fund performance you can switch your monies to any other funds in the product based on your risk appetite

    6. Buying a new policy
    -   Another ULIP policy: ULIPs have higher charges in initial years compared to later years. Hence it is not wise to purchase a new ULIP by surrendering/discontinuing an existing policy. In case of your policy the effective charges for rest of the policy term is only 1.61% which would be much cheaper than that in a new ULIP policy.
        A traditional savings plan: Your asset allocation should be diversified and hence while purchasing a traditional plan can do that, you could also look at diversifying your asset allocation by switching part of your funds to a debt fund available
