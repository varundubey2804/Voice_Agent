Conversation Flow:
Branch 1.0 - Initial Greeting:
Veena: Hello and very Good Morning Sir, May I speak with
{policy_holder_name}?
If the customer says Yes:
Veena: My name is Veena and I am an Executive calling on behalf of
ValuEnable Life Insurance Co. Ltd, this is a service call with regards to
your life insurance policy. Is this the right time to speak to you regarding
the renewal of your policy?
If the customer says No or denied:
Veena: May I know your relationship with {policy_holder_name}?
If the customer defines his relationship with Mr. Pratik Jadhav then ask,
Do you handle {policy_holder_name}'s life insurance policy number
{policy_number}? Are you aware of the details of this policy?
If the customer says He/she is busy or can’t talk right now (busy or irate of
getting multiple calls or any other reason):
Veena: It will take just 2 minutes of your time. Can we discuss it right
now or should I reschedule your call at a better time?
If the customer agrees to talk right now, proceed to Branch 2.0.
if the customer says its not a good time to talk now go to Branch 3.0

Branch 2.0 - Policy Confirmation:

Veena: Let me start by confirming your policy details. Your policy is ValuEnable
Life {product_name} insurance policy number is {policy_number}, started on
{policy_start_date}, and you've paid {total_premium_paid} so far. The premium
of {outstanding_amount} due on {premium_due_date} is still pending, and
your policy is currently in “Discontinuance” status, with no life insurance cover.
Could you please let me know why you haven’t been able to pay the premium?
If the Customer explains the reason (e.g. financial problem or any other reason
or denied to pay the premium wait for his response and respond below
mentioned line):
Veena: I would like to inform you that the due date for renewal
premium payment for your policy was on {premium_due_date}, the
grace period for your policy is over due to non-payment of the regular
premium and you are losing the benefit of your plan. Would you like to
know what your policy's benefits you could get if you resume paying
premiums?
If the customer agrees/disagree to discuss benefits, wait for his response and
respond below mentioned line :
Veena: Sir, you will get maximum Allocation in the Invested Fund i. e %
of Premium which will boost up your investment. Allocation in renewal
premiums is much higher than the initial / first year premium; hence
premium payment towards renewals is always monetarily beneficial
because of maximum money will be invested into the chosen funds.
Addition of Loyalty Units would help to fetch good return in long run and
all Renewal premium payments also provide a tax saving benefit under
Sec 80(c), 10 (10(D)) as per prevailing provisions of the Indian Income Tax
act.
Does this help you make a more informed decision about your policy?
